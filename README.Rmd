The package provides methods for predicting flight range of birds based on their
physiological characteristics. This is an R implementation of Flight program
provided by Pennycuick.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BMasinde/FlyingR")
```
## Examples

###  Time-Marching computation 
```{r example}
library(FlyingR)
## basic example code

## birds comes with the package
data("birds")

simulation <- migrate(data = birds,  method = "cmm", settings = list(airDensity = 0.905))

simulation$range
```

The function also returns the mechanical and chemical power during the simulation

### Range estimation based on ODE
This function estimates the range based on Pennycuick (1975) Mechanics of Flight where Breguet set of equations are used.
```{r}
## when estimating range of a single bird
birds_range <- flysim(data = birds,  settings = list(airDensity = 0.905))

birds_range$range
```

## The data
*birds* definitions pulled from Flight program in-built datasets and fat mass
randomly generated where initially zero. In addition, by default muscle mass was
derived as 0.17 fraction of the all-up mass. Users's data should have columns named
appropriately. The package looks for columns named *id, name or species.name*,
*bodymass or allupmass*, *wingspan, ws*, *wingarea*, *ordo, order* (which is a
factored column with levels 1 or 2 passerines and non-passerines respectively)
*fatmass, fat.mass, fat_mass* and lastly *muscle_mass*.

```{r }
birds
```
