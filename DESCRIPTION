Description: Based on Pennycuick's book, aim of the package is to estimate the flight range of birds. Pennycuick,
    provides the Flight program but it requires manual entry of birds which can be tedious when there are thousands
    of birds to estimate. This package implements methods 1 and 2 of the Breguet's equation (described in the book)
    to estimate flight range.
