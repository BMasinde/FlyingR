Description: Based on Pennycuick (2008) and (1975), aim of the package is to 
    estimate the flight range of birds. The Flight program which compliments the
    book requires manual entry of birds which can be tedious when there are 
    thousands of birds to estimate. This package implements two fixed wing 
    methods discussed in Pennycuick (1975) and time-marching computation
    method "constant muscle mass" as in Pennycuick(1998).
