# FlyingR 0.2

* Name change from flying to FlyingR

* Shortfall in minimum energy from protein, in "csp" and "csw", is now met by adjustinig the airframe mass. Previously the entire minimum was drawn from the
aiframe mass, which is wrong. So now "csp" and "csw" account for 2% - 3% of the 
total energy and the remainder is met from adjusring airframe mass.

* Simulations run faster

* Stop over mass calculator function (though it doesn't account for 
protein intake).
